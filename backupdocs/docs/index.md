# Wellcome to the PLT Anomaly Detection Tool!

**This repo is a efficient implementation of an anomaly detection algorithm suited for the data coming from the PLT-BRIL detector, is is intended to be robust to experimental noise and not highly tuneable.**

For now, the implementation is a Proof-of-Concept, and looks forward to be generalized to other usecases and dockerized.
